# This software is designed to connect one keyboard and mouse to multiple computers.
# Built with Java 1.8

# Cross Compatible:
- Windows
- MacOS
- Linux

# So that you don't have to constantly switch and itnerrupt your work flow.

# Usage:
- Download and Install Java 1.8 - https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
- Pick out a PC that you want to use as the Keyboard and Mouse - we will refer to this PC from now on as the "Host"
- Run Harmoney on the "Host", if you are on MacOS you may need to hold control while opening it if it says something about "unknown developer"
- On the "Host" select "Server (Share this Mouse/ Keyboard)"
- Please take note that in the bottom left corner there is an IP.

- The "[EMPTY]" buttons represnt PC slots.
- Click on a button to assign a PC to that slot.
- Assign PC's from your Queue to the buttons that correspond to your setup's relative screen positions.
- For example:
- I have a desktop, which will act as the "Host", and a laptop to the left of it.
- I can choose to assign "This PC" to the middle button.
- Then I would click the button to the left of "This PC" to assign my laptop to it.
- To get PC's into the Queue run Harmony on a differnt computer.
- Click "Client (Use another Mouse/ Keyboard)"
- Type in the IP you took note of in a previous step and press Connect.
- Once the "Host" PC assigns the pc from the Queue into the field this pc is set.

- To traverse PC's bring the mouse up to the border of your screen.


This is the open source Java alternative to the paid Software Synergy.
There are some features missing from this that are included in the paid Synergy (Clipboard Sharing, File Sharing, Screensaver Sync, and SSL Encryption).
